# Network Object Linking

<orange>Network Object Linkers</orange> (<orange>or NOLs</orange>), are the central part of the <orange>General Network
Object Management</orange> (or <orange>GNOM</orange>) system.

A <orange>NOL</orange> is a class that <orange>registers</orange> Network Objects and who is able to find a registered network object using
its <orange>reference</orange>.
NOLs also <orange>ensures</orange> to know if its registered references are also known, or not on other engines.<br></br>

## Architecture

The <orange>Network Object Linkage</orange> operates in a <orange>tree architecture</orange>.<br></br>
An object linker can contain <orange>children</orange>, and when a request is performed on a linker, its implementation is free to decide to delegate the
request to its children.<br></br>
The <orange>root linker</orange> of the <orange>linker tree</orange> is the <orange> General Network Object Linker</orange> (<orange>or GNOL</orange>).
This special linker contains sub root linkers that can be defined by the user.

Here is an architecture diagram <u>example</u> of the GNOL tree.

export function Diagram(style) {
    const {colorMode, _} = useColorMode()
    if (colorMode === 'dark') return <Diagram_Light style={style}/>
    else return <Diagram_Dark style={style}/>
}

<Diagram style={{marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto"}}/>
