# Network Object Linking

<orange>Network Object Linkers</orange> (<orange>or NOLs</orange>), are the central part of the <orange>General Network
    Object Management</orange> (or <orange>GNOM</orange>) system.

A <orange>NOL</orange> is a class that <orange>registers</orange> Network Objects and who is able to find a registered network object using
its <orange>reference</orange>.
NOLs also <orange>ensures</orange> to know if its registered references are also known, or not on other engines.<br></br>

## Architecture

The <orange>Network Object Linkage</orange> operates in a <orange>tree architecture</orange>.<br></br>
An object linker can contain <orange>children</orange>, and when a request is performed on a linker, its implementation is free to decide to delegate the
request to its children.<br></br>
The <orange>root linker</orange> of the <orange>linker tree</orange> is the <orange> General Network Object Linker</orange> (<orange>or GNOL</orange>).
This special linker contains sub root linkers that can be defined by the user.

Users can use any linkers in the tree, but the <a href={pages.gnom.persistence.index}>Persistence System</a> directly uses the GNOL.
This way, when the persistence system makes a request to the

Here is an architecture diagram <u>example</u> of the GNOL tree.

export function GNOL(style) {
    const {colorMode, _} = useColorMode()
    if (colorMode === 'dark') return <GNOL_Light style={style}/>
    else return <GNOL_Dark style={style}/>
}

<GNOL style={{marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto"}}/>

## Deep look at Network Object Linkers

### 1. Their roles in the persistence system.
Serialization is a very important issue, and when you design an application and wants it to communicate
between the server and / or other connected clients, the way that you'll choose how to send data to peers is a considerable question.
The Framework's <a href={pages.gnom.persistence.index}>Persistence System</a> is autonomous enough to support almost any object serialization / deserialization,
but it still needs some rules for objects that must receive special handling. Network Objects are those object that gets special handlings, and
the most of the time, you just want you network objects to get reused by the deserialization process, that's why


### 2. Implementation
In this part, we'll take a look at how to implement a Network Object Linker.

export function NOL(style) {
    const {colorMode, _} = useColorMode()
    if (colorMode === 'dark') return <NOL_Light style={style}/>
    else return <NOL_Dark style={style}/>
}
