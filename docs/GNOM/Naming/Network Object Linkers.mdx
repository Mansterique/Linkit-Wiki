# Network Object Linking

<orange>Network Object Linkers</orange> (<orange>or NOLs</orange>), are the central part of the <orange>General Network
    Object Management</orange> (or <orange>GNOM</orange>) system.

A <orange>NOL</orange> is a class that <orange>registers</orange> Network Objects and who is able to find a registered network object using
its <orange>reference</orange>.
NOLs also <orange>ensures</orange> to know if its registered references are also known, or not on other engines.<br></br>

## Architecture

The <orange>Network Object Linkage</orange> operates in a <orange>tree architecture</orange>.<br></br>
An object linker can contain <orange>lower-level linkers</orange>, and when a request is performed on a linker, its implementation is free to decide to delegate the
request to its children.<br></br>
The <orange>root linker</orange> of the <orange>linker tree</orange> is the <orange> General Network Object Linker</orange> (<orange>or GNOL</orange>).
This special linker contains sub root linkers that can be defined by the user.

Users can use any linkers in the tree, but the <a href={pages.gnom.persistence.index}>Persistence System</a> directly starts from the GNOL to retrieve the objects.

Here is an architecture diagram <u>example</u> of the GNOL tree.

export function GNOL(style) {
    const {colorMode, _} = useColorMode()
    if (colorMode === 'dark') return <GNOLLight style={style}/>
    else return <GNOLDark style={style}/>
}

<GNOL style={{marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto"}}/>


## Their roles in the persistence system.

<p>
    <orange>Serialization</orange> is a very important issue,
    and when you design an application and wants it to <orange>communicate </orange>
    between the server and / or other connected clients, the way that you'll choose how to send data is a considerable
    question.<br></br>
    The Framework's <a href={pages.gnom.persistence.index}>Persistence System</a> is autonomous enough to
    support <orange>almost any</orange> object serialization / deserialization,
    but it still needs some rules for objects that must receive special handling. <br></br>
    <orange>Network Objects </orange>
    are those objects that receive special handling, and
    the most of the time, you just want you network objects to get reused in the deserialization process, that's why you
    usually reuse a linker, such as
    the <a href={doc("fr.linkit.engine.gnom.referencing.linker.MapNetworkObjectLinker")}>MapNetworkObjectLinker</a> as
    you just want somewhere to put your objects.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, the real first interest in a <orange>custom linker</orange> is when you want to perform <orange>initialization procedures</orange> when a
    Network Object
    handleable by your linker gets <orange>deserialized</orange>.<br></br>
    Second interest is when you have a certain data structure (let's say a database) and wants it to be used in the
    GNOL.
</p>

## Implementation
In this part, we'll take a look at how to implement a Network Object Linker.

export function NOL(style) {
    const {colorMode, _} = useColorMode()
    if (colorMode === 'dark') return <NOLLight style={style}/>
    else return <NOLDark style={style}/>
}

Here is the Network Object Linker UML diagram:

<NOL/>

As you can see, an Object Linker is also a presence handler for its registered references.
If you ever tried to implement the `NetworkObjectLinker` you must have been surprised to see that you had to implement
`getPresence(R)` and `isPresentOnEngine(String, R)`. Which must have confused you because you don't know how to handle your references presences.

### AbstractNetworkPresenceHandler

Any implementation of the `NetworkObjectLinker` trait should also extend the `AbstractNetworkPresenceHandler`<a href={doc("fr.linkit.engine.gnom.referencing.presence.AbstractNetworkPresenceHandler")}>*</a> abstract class
that will implement all the presence handling and let you implement the `findObject(R)` method.

```scala
class DatabaseLinker(omc: ObjectManagementChannel, db: Connection) extends AbstractNetworkPresenceHandler[DatabaseObjectReference](omc, null) with NetworkObjectLinker[DatabaseObjectReference] {
    override def findObject(ref: DatabaseObjectReference): Option[NetworkObject[_ <: DatabaseObjectReference] = {
        //use the database connection to retrieve the object
    }
}
```

By extending this class you'll find out that its constructor needs an `ObjectManagementChannel` and a _nullable_ parent linker.<br></br>
If your linker is a root linker, parent must be null. the `ObjectManagementChannel` is initially accessible only when
supplying a root linker to the GNOL.


### Register the linker in the GNOL

```scala
val linker: DatabaseLinker = gnol.addRootLinker(omc => new DatabaseLinker(omc))
linker.findObject(DatabaseObjectReference(...)) match {
    case Some(X) => ...
    case None => ...
}
```
