# Network Object References

Network Object References are <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html">case classes</a>, that contains
any kind of data defined by the user, that defines the information needed for the naming system to retrieve its bounded network object.

## Network Object Reference implementations and architecture.

A Network Object Reference object is an object that contains the needed information to locate a network object in the <a href="Network Object Linkers">GNOL Tree</a>

Let's say we create a game, in which we have a map, with house objects, player objects and weapon objects.
Each objects of the map can be categorized in this way:

- `@game/map/house/x` for all houses in the map
- `@game/map/player/x` for players connected on the map
- `@game/map/weapon/x` for weapons in the map

We can notice that the references are acting like paths in a File System, we have `game` category, parent of `map` category, parent of sub categories `house`, `player` and `weapon`.

This way, for each category, we have an implementation of the `NetworkObjectReference`<a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.referencing.NetworkObjectReference")}>*</a> interface :

export function Diagram() {
    const {colorMode, _} = useColorMode()
    if (colorMode === 'dark') return <DiagramLight/>
    else return <DiagramDark/>
}

<Diagram/>

We can see that for each reference type, we have an attributed Object Linker
