# Network Objects

## What is a network object

<p>
    <orange>Network Objects</orange>
    are an essential part of the <orange>GNOM</orange> System.<br></br>
    Their particularity is that they are bound with a <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nor}>reference</a>.<br></br>
    This concept is really <orange>simple</orange>, but this allows the framework to perform <orange>packet stream size
    optimisation</orange>,
    by sending the reference instead of the object itself, and, on top of that, sending the reference of an object
    allows to solve <orange>recurrent issues</orange> when developing a network based system,
    and eases the manipulation of <i>network</i> objects between <orange>remote engines</orange>
</p>

## Different kinds of Network Objects
A Network Object can also be a <orange>Static</orange> or <orange>Dynamic</orange> Network Object. <br></br>
The concept of Static, Dynamic, and _Regular_ Network Objects only differs by their <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nop}>presence</a> handling over the network.<br></br>

### Regular Network Objects

The <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.referencing.NetworkObject")}>`NetworkObject`</a> trait is the base class for declaring a network object.<br></br>
The only thing exposed in this class is the reference of the object.<br></br>

To retrieve the presence of a regular network object reference, you can use its linker, or a parent of the targeted linker (such as the GNOL).
```scala
val linker: NetworkObjectLinker[R] = network.gnol
val no: NetworkObject = ???
val presence: NetworkObjectPresence = linker.getPresence(no.reference)
```

### Dynamic Network Objects
A Dynamic Network Object presence is handled like a regular Network Object,
the only thing is that their presence is exposed in the <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.referencing.DynamicNetworkObject")}>`DynamicNetworkObject`</a> trait.

```scala
val dno: DynamicNetworkObject = ???
val presence: NetworkObjectPresence = dno.presence
```

### Static Network Objects
Static Network Objects are supposed to be present on any connected engine.
This particularity makes the persistence system handle them specially.<br></br>
When the serialization process meets a `StaticNetworkObject`, it'll suppose that the object is present on any engine, as
it is _statically_ present on the network.

Thus, the serializer will presume that the object is already present on the targeted engine, and will send the object's reference
without performing any presence checks.

## How to create a Network Object
To create a Network Object, you'll need 3 things:

1. Define (or use) a `NetworkObjectReference`. Take a look at the <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nor}>Network Object Reference</a> page to learn more.
we'll use `MyNetworkObjectReference` as an example.
2. Define your network object class by extending the <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.reference.NetworkObject")}>NetworkObject</a> interface.
```scala
class MyNetworkObject(override val reference: MyNetworkObjectReference) extends NetworkObject[MyNetworkObjectReference]
```
3. Put the instances of this class in a <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.reference.linker.NetworkObjectLinker")}>Network Object Linker </a>.
You can define your own Network Object Linker, or use the <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.reference.linker.DefaultNetworkObjectLinker")}>DefaultNetworkObjectLinker</a> as
a linker for your objects. You can also prefer the <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.reference.ContextObjectLinker")}>ContextObjectLinker </a>
of your <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.packet.channel.PacketChannel")}>PacketChannel</a>.<br></br>
```scala
val ref = MyNetworkReference("tommy")
val myNetworkObject = new MyNetworkObject(ref)
val defaultLinker = network.gnol.defaultNOL
defaultLinker.save(myNetworkObject)
```
Did not understand a thing of the last sentence ? take a look at <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nol}>Network Object Linker page</a>
to understand what is a network object linker, and know what linker you should use depending on the context and your needs.

That's it. Now the framework knows your object,
and if another engine also have an object referenced at `MyNetworkReference("tommy")`,
no matters the used linker, the referencing will work.

#### So what happens if an engine sends a network object that is not referenced on the targeted engine ?

The handling of a network object whose reference is not registered on targeted engine is different depending on the type
of Network Object involved:
- <u>Regular / Dynamic Network Objects</u><a> </a>
The object is sent on the distant engine, then the distant engine will register the object's reference.
- <u>Static Network Objects</u><a> </a>
Because they are intended to be static over the network, if an engine receives an unregistered static object reference,
it'll throw an exception.


## Use cases
### Serialize non-serializable objects

<p>
    The <orange>current persistence system</orange> is already able to handle objects that are <orange>not
    designed</orange> to support <orange>serialization</orange>,
    and is enough <orange>configurable</orange> to let the user define how an object should
    be <orange>serialised/deserialized </orange>
    if the default 'field copy/paste' method is not convenient.<br></br>
    however, there is still enough reason why serialization/deserialization of an object can be undesirable:
</p>
<p>
    For example, the trait <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.application.ApplicationContext")}>ApplicationContext</a>'s
    implementations objects are just <orange>too big</orange> to get
    send threw the <orange>network</orange>. Moreover, <orange>they are intended to have only one instance in the
    JVM</orange>. Without the GNOM (General Network's Objects Management), if the <orange>Application
    object</orange> is set into a packet, and then the packet is send to any
    engine, the the <a href={pages.gnom.persistence.index}>persistence</a> system will handle the
    <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.application.ApplicationContext")}> Application</a> object as such, and so, the receiver
    of the packet
    will end up with two applications objects, <orange>which is problematic because only one ApplicationContext is
    intended</orange>.
    Thanks to the <orange>GNOM System</orange>, this kind of <orange>conceptual problem</orange> can
    be <orange>avoided</orange> as only the <orange>application's reference</orange> will
    be sent in the socket, and then the receiver's GNOM system will replace the received reference by its Application
    object.
</p>

### Relative Objects
<p>
    Well, as <orange>NetworkObjects</orange> are bound to their <orange>reference</orange>, this means that
    a <orange>Network Object Reference</orange> (or <orange>NOR</orange>) can point to a <orange>network
    object </orange> that can be <orange>different</orange> depending on the machine.<br></br>
</p>




<orange>As an example</orange>, let's assume that we are making a multiplayer game.<br></br>

For this game, we define a trait `Player extends NetworkObject[PlayerReference]` and two implementations of Player:
- `ControlledPlayer`, relative to each connected <orange>engine</orange>, which is the player object of the <orange>human behind the screen</orange> that can actually
control the player
- `RemotePlayer`, for remote players that are connected to our session.

We can define a <orange>reference</orange> (such as `@session/players/controller`) that all `ControlledPlayer` objects of the <orange>network</orange>
will be bound to (invoking `ControlledPlayer#reference` will return the reference `@session/players/controller`). using this trick,
once the `ControlledPlayer` object is sent to an engine, as Network Object are replaced by their reference during the serialization, the
engines that will receive the reference will take the object referenced at `@session/players/controller`, which will result
to its own `ControlledPlayer` instance.

This way, we can easily create packets that says 'hey, do something with your own controlled player'

Conversely, we could define a <orange>reference</orange> to each player connected on the session.<br></br>
For engine '<orange>n</orange>', we would have reference `@session/players/n`, and then,
we bind our `ControlledPlayer` object to the network object reference where '<orange>n</orange>' is equals to our actual <orange>engine's identifier</orange>.<br></br>
This way, when we receive or send a player object, we are sure that it will be the <orange>correct type</orange> depending on which engine the object lands,
and the <orange>conversion</orange> from the 'RemotePlayer' object of the <orange>engine<orange> that sends us our </orange>own player instance</orange> (our `ControlledPlayer`) will be <orange>naturally performed</orange>.

### Reinjecting same objects references
<p>
    Note: Do not be confused between <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nor}>Network Object Reference</a> and a normal object
    reference. Object References, or a 'reference'
    is simply the normal reference of an object,
    the usual term to point to an instance (variables, fields etc) <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nor}>Network Object
    References are</a>, as said multiple times, the
    reference of an object <orange>threw the network</orange>.
</p>
<p>
    Using <orange>normal objects</orange>, if you send twice the <orange>same object</orange> to an engine,
    the engine will get <orange>two different clones</orange> of the object you sent.
</p>
<p>
    Using a <orange>NetworkObject</orange>, you ensure that the object will have <orange>only one instance</orange> of
    itself on engines, without having any
    <orange>undesirable</orange> clones.
</p>
<p>
    Using <a href={doc("fr.linkit.api.gnom.persistence.context.PersistenceConfig")}>PersistenceConfig </a>
    and <a href={"fr.linkit.api.gnom.reference.linker.ContextObjectLinker"}>ContextObjectLinker</a>]], it is possible to
    <orange>bind any object</orange> to a <orange>network reference</orange>. <br></br>
    Binding a regular object to a network reference using ContextObjectLinkers is sufficient for the objects to be
    handled as a <orange>network object</orange> by the
    <orange>persistence system</orange>.
