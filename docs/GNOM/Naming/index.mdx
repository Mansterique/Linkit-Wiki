# GNOL - Introduction

<p>
    The General Network Object Linkage (or <orange>GNOL</orange>) is a <orange>Naming system</orange> in which
    <a href={pages.gnom.naming.no}> Network Objects</a> are referenced.<br></br>
    <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nor}> Network Objects' References</a> are stored in the GNOL,
    and each peer of the network handle their own set of Network Object Reference using
    <a href={pages.gnom.naming.nol}> Network Object Linkers</a> (or <orange>NOLs</orange>).<br></br>
    A <orange>NOL</orange> is in charge of <orange>binding</orange> a <orange>Network Object</orange> to it's <orange>reference </orange>
    and provides information about the presence of a Network Object's reference in the linker.
    This way, an engine can wonder if another engine have a bound value for a given reference
</p>

<p>
    The <orange>GNOL</orange> is mainly used by the persistence system, in order to send a network object's reference instead of the network object.<br></br>
    See how the <a href={pages.gnom.persistence.index}>persistence system</a> deals with network objects and uses the GNOL to avoid making copies of the same network objects
    by injecting the same object's instances contained in a packet when it get deserialized.
