# Introduction


Connected Objects are a powerful evolution of Network Objects.<br></br>
They comes with an enhanced and configurable RMI system.

Here are the listed features of the connected objects system.
The <a href={pages.gnom.caches.connected_objects.cache}>next page</a> to know how to start using your connected objects
Make sure you understood the <a href={pages.gnom.naming.index}>Network Objects concept</a> to do not get lost

# Features

## Simple Remote Method Invocations (RMIs)

```scala
class MyObject {
    def foo(): Unit = {
        print("foo called !")
    }
}
```

<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/Simple RMI.svg")}
         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/Simple RMI.svg")}
         style={{width: "75%", height: "75%", display:"block", margin:"auto"}}/>

<details>
    <summary>Broadcast any method invocation on remote engines</summary>
    <div>
        All method invocations can be spread out on other engines in order to simulate a "cloud" object being accessed
        from other engines and which internal state is completely synchronized.
    </div>
</details>

## Flow control (agreements).
Control who receives an invocation when a method get called, and who we choose to return a result.

```scala
class MyObject {
    /**
     * This method prints a param and return the current JVM version.
     * */
    def doSomething(param: String): String = {
        print(s"invocation called ! ($param)")
        System.getProperty("java.version")
    }
}
```

<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements.svg")}
         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements.svg")}
         style={{width: "100%", height: "100%", display:"block", margin:"auto"}}/>

<details>
    <summary>Invocation Agreements</summary>
    <div>
        You can define a contract for methods and specify agreements that controls the invocation flow over the network.<br></br>
        As the example shows, it's also possible to <orange>appoint</orange> an engine that'll have to return a result
        when performing a call on multiple engines<br></br>
    </div>
</details>

### Also supports simple conditions

<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements - Conditions.drawio.svg")}
         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements - Conditions.drawio.svg")}
         style={{width: "100%", height: "100%", display:"block", margin:"auto"}}/>


You can define some constraints on your agreements depending on the initial method execution context:

<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements - Conditions (Contract).drawio.svg")}
         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/RMI Agreements - Conditions (Contract).drawio.svg")}
         style={{width: "50%", height: "50%", display:"block", margin:"auto"}}/>

:::note
On the diagram, the object is red for the engine that initially owns the object.<br></br>
Connected Object owners are the engines that initially posted their objects over the network.

## Know who is the invocation origin
```scala

Using the static method `ExecutorEngine.currentEngine`, you can know who is the origin of the execution of a method.
This is actually very powerfull for making APIs and client-server actions as you can choose to perform different actions depending on the client
that is performing a _request_

class MyObject {
    /**
     * This method prints who originally invocated the method.
     * */
    def printInvoker(): Unit = {
        val trigerrer = ExecutorEngine.currentEngine
        print(s"invocation called ! this RMI has been triggered from " + trigerrer.identifier)
    }
}
```

<Diagram light={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/ExecutorEngine.svg")}
         dark={require("/src/components/diagrams/Connected Object/Features/ExecutorEngine.svg")}
         style={{width: "75%", height: "75%", display:"block", margin:"auto"}}/>

## Static accesses

## Apply modifiers on parameters and return values

## Inner object connection

### Also Connect field values of connected objects

### Also Connect param and return values on method invocations

## Remote Implementation
