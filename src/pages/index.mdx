# The Linkit Framework

<p>
    <orange>Linkit</orange> is a <pink>Scala</pink> <orange>framework</orange> that handles the <orange>network</orange> exchanges of an application.
</p>

<p>
    The Framework's network communication is performed in a high level, allowing the user to work in
    an <orange>object-oriented communication</orange>.
</p>
<p>
    The Framework's <a href="/Linkit/docs/GNOM/Persistence/x">persistence system</a> allows the user to send almost any non-serializable objects
</p>
Shared objects can be converted into "Connected Objects" in which method calls can be triggered according to a defined contract amongst actual and distant versions of the connected object.
This special handling is available for instances of any public / non-final classes.
